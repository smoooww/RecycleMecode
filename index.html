        <h2>Why is recycling important?</h2>
        <p class="text-danger">The global problem of our time is the pollution of the world's waters with plastic. Thus, according to the data of the world ocean research, the total weight of plastic, which floats freely, is more than 270 thousand tons. And in the waters of the Pacific Ocean a "garbage" island has formed, the area of which reaches 15 million km2. Over the last 40 years, the volume of plastic garbage has increased 100 times. All this leads to increased mortality of marine animals, because they take plastic for food, which leads to their death. This applies not only to fish, but also to birds.</p>

        <h2 class="hidden">What's the real scale of pollution?</h2>
        <p class="text-danger hidden itemOne">Every year, the average person produces more than 50 kilograms of plastic waste. Every minute, about 1,000,000 plastic bottles are sold around the world.</p>
        <p class="text-danger hidden itemTwo">Plastic is the most common type of waste. Plastic products make up to 80% of the waste that pollutes the world's oceans. The annual increase in plastic consumption is up to 8% per year.</p>
        <p class="text-danger hidden itemThree">In total, about 14% of the material consumed worldwide is recycled, most of it is landfilled. Only 9% of the world's plastics have ever been recycled. Most plastic waste is collected in landfills or decomposes in nature.</p>
        <p class="text-danger hidden itemFour">It is predicted that if the status quo remains unchanged, by 2050, about 12 billion tons of plastic will be stored in landfills.</p>

        <h2>What do plastic recycling numbers actually mean?</h2>
        <p class="numbers-text">You can determine whether a particular type of plastic can be recycled by its labeling.
             Each plastic product should be labeled with special symbols that indicate the type of plastic from which it is made. 
             This information helps to determine whether or not the plastic can be recycled. 
            Plastic labeling consists of three arrows that form a triangle.
             Inside the triangle is a number from 1 to 7 and sometimes a letter. The number indicates the type of plastic:</p>

            <h3>#1 - PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate)</h3>
            <p class="text-recycle">PET, also known as PETE or polyethylene terephthalate, is among the most common types of plastic.
                It's a lightweight, clear resin, and is more energy efficient to produce and transport than other types of plastic.
                This transparent type of plastic is most commonly used for food packaging because of its strength and temperature resistance.
                It’s also highly shatter resistant.</p>
            <p class="text-recycle"><b>Common products:</b> Soft drink, juice, and water bottles,
                salad dressing containers, peanut butter and cooking oil jars, and mouthwash.</p>
            <p class="text-recycle"><b>Can it be recycled?</b> Yes – PET is fully recyclable, and is in fact the most recycled plastic worldwide.</p>

            <p class="text-recycle">HDPE stands for high-density polyethylene, an opaque plastic made with petroleum.
                It's another common type of plastic for consumer goods because it's rigid, durable,
                 and can withstand stress – therefore, it has a wide variety of uses.</p>
            <p class="text-recycle"><b>Common products:</b> Milk jugs, bottle caps, food storage containers,
                laundry detergent, fuel cans, shampoo bottles, outdoor furniture, plastic mailing envelopes, and milk crates. </p>
            <p class="text-recycle"><b>Can it be recycled?</b> Yes, HDPE is generally accepted at most recycling centers.</p>

            <p class="text-recycle">Low-density polyethylene, or LDPE, is HDPE's less-rigid counterpart.
                 It's relatively transparent, and is less dense but more resilient than other types of plastic. 
                 A lot of plastic wrappings are made of LDPE plastic.</p>
            <p class="text-recycle"><b>Common products:</b> Bread wrappers, cling wrap, grocery, trash and dry cleaning bags,

            <p class="text-recycle">Polypropylene, or PP, is a highly durable form of plastic.
                 It's tough, has a slippery surface, and is less dense than other common plastics, so it's useful for items that need to bend without breaking.</p>
